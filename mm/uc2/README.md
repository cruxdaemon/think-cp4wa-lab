### Use Case 2: Flat line causing Slow Response Time

#### Metric Manager Anomaly Alarms

The usual way that an Operation center works, is through `Management by Exception`. Basically the SREs is expected to be notified if something goes wrong.  Metric Manager improves this by sending anomaly.  It sends alarms/alerts when something is about to go wrong.  These alerts allows the SREs with `Incident Avoidance` tools, hence improving `Mean time between failure`.

#### Flat line causing Slow Response Time

When a metric normally varies and then stops varying it almost always means something has gone wrong. It's stuck, or something feeding it is stuck or something it's sending to is stuck.  The ability to detect this behaviour is useful. All customers with systems that have limits of some kind â€“ memory on a machine, connections to a database, traffic through a link, flow through a pipe etc. will find this valuable.  Metric Manager allows you to detect the threshold has been met without knowing the actual limit itself.

#### The Scenario
The data for this use case is from a customer when the connections to their database was behaving unexpectedly. The connection pool for the customers application normally grew and shrunk constantly throughout the day as the usage of the system varied but Predictive Insights detected that this behaviour had changed. The application was stuck at the limit of it's resources and this was slowing the performance for users. It gave a clear starting point and root cause for a poor performance issue, which are notoriously difficult to diagnosis.

#### The lab exercise.
Close your current tab from the previous use case.   Click the Flag icon (for incidents) from the menu strip on the right.  Select `Detected Anomalies` menu item.  If you are familiar with Watson AIOps Event Viewer, this is the `Event Viewer` page with the `MetricManagerAnomalies` Filter and `MetricManagerView` View already preselected.

Observe:
- From the top bar you can see that there is 1 `Major` alarms (Orange Exclamation Symbol) and 12 `Minor` alarms (Yellow Exclaimation Symbol).
- The default Severity for the anomaly alerts is `Minor`.
- Check the list for individual anomalies discovered by Predictive Insights.You can see when an anomaly has started and finished occurring in `FirstOccurrence` and `LastOccurrence` columns. `Summary` column describes the anomaly. `Count` shows how many times the anomaly has occurred. Columns like `Node`, `AnomalousResource`, `AnomalousMetric`, `Direction` provide additional information on the anomaly.
- There is one alert with severity `Major`. Major anomalies represent consolidated alarms found by Metric Manager. In the `Summary` column you can see the type of consolidation and how many metrics or nodes are involved.

Select the alert with Summary `Connectionpoolsize is now a flat line where before it was varying` and Node `PrimaryKWPUBIIS06`, right click, and select __ServiceDiagnosis__.

You will see the following graph:

<br>

Observe:

- The line used to go up and down and then hit a flat line, and Metric Manager hightlight the flat line in red background.

We want to zoom on the diagram.  So click on the start diagram anywhere you want to see the start time, and pull to the right, until you passed the red box.  See the following diagram for approximate zoom area:

<br>

In the zoomed graph, hover your mouse on top of the flat line, and you can see that the metrics has hit the 3,200 `connection pool size`.

Look at the bottom part of the page, and you can see the causal group.
Note the `Processortime` and the `Usertime` are in the causal group, with flat line anomaly.
Select the `Usertime` metrics.

Observe:

- When the `Connectionpoolsize` hit a limit of 3,200, the User processor time become starved.  This translate to **Slow Response Time**.  The metric Response time is for this particular case is not provided to Metric Manager, however you can make a conclusion that as the system has reached is maximum connection pool size, the service and users that depends on the connection has to wait for the connection to be released; this translate to poor performance.

- Very often you do not have visibility on Connection Pool Size has reached a maximum value.  There may not be alarms generated by the normal monitoring system; making this condition hard to detect.
