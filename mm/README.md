## IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps: Metric Manager

Watson AIOps Metric Manager consume and analyse your metrics or time series data and provides **early warning** of *abnormal behaviour* which might be indicative of potential outage, service degradation or unexpected change. 

It uses AI to dynamically builds thresholds and baselines without need for configuration, so you do not need to keep adjusting the baseline like you did in a traditional Performance Manager system.
Watson AIOps Metric Manager evaluates based on normal behaviours of the data, and it can detect anomalous behaviour on KPIs (Key Performance Indicator). Normal behaviour is learned through an initial training period to build an analytics model and constant model retraining as new data loaded thereafter. 

If a KPI is deemed anomalous an alarm is raised. Related alarms are consolidated in a casual group. Alarms can be viewed and action in the Watson AIOps Event Manager. If required you can trigger the runbook automation, available in Event Manager, to resolve your potential issue before it happen.
In Operation, once the metric data is continuously ingested by Metric Manager, as an SRE you will be notified of possible unresolved issues through the consolidated alerts generated by Metric Manager. 
Here is a diagram on Watson AIOps Metric Manager.
